# Project Description 
---
The Sensor Hub PCB project is a board directed to facilitate system integration and conduct sensor fusion for all control sensors(Throttle Potentiometer, Steer, Brakes, etc.) on the vehicle. The board utilizes an STM32F-series microcontroller with a (CAN) BUS communication protocol design.
