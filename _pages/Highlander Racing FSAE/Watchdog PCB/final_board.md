# Project Description 
---
The Sensor Hub PCB project is a board directed to facilitate system integration and conduct sensor fusion for all control sensors(Throttle Potentiometer, Steer, Brakes, etc.) on the vehicle. The board utilizes an STM32F-series microcontroller with a (CAN) BUS communication protocol design.

# Revisions 
- Test points were added for more efficient board testing
- Changed secondary connector to another Conn-Ampseal-776267-1
- Added LED indicators for the STM32 
- Reworked layout and validated circuitry in schematics
