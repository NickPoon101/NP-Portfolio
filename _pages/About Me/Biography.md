## Hey — I’m Nicholas Poon
- [Link to Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1clmUirRMx5Xnpp7sCl0jpPV9g7l_HCVp/view?usp=drive_link)

I’m an Electrical Engineering student focused on building practical systems at the intersection of **RF, embedded, and hardware design**.  
I like projects where the requirements are real (range, power, noise, reliability) and the solution has to work outside the lab.

## What I’m into

- **RF / wireless systems** (links, antennas, front-ends, real-world constraints)
- **Embedded systems** (MCUs, sensors, protocols, debugging)
- **PCB design** (layout, power integrity, grounding, bring-up)
- **Systems thinking** (testing, iteration, documentation, making it robust)
