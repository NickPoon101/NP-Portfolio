## Hey — I’m Nicholas Poon
- [Link to Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1clmUirRMx5Xnpp7sCl0jpPV9g7l_HCVp/view?usp=drive_link)

I’m Nicholas Poon, an Electrical Engineering student at UC Riverside. My main focus is PCB design, and I’m actively growing my skills in RF and high-speed hardware. I’m also into robotics, especially projects where the board design, signal integrity, and real-world testing all matter.

## What I’m into

- **RF / wireless systems** (links, antennas, front-ends, real-world constraints)
- **Embedded systems** (MCUs, sensors, protocols, debugging)
- **PCB design** (layout, power integrity, grounding, bring-up)
- **Systems thinking** (testing, iteration, documentation, making it robust)
