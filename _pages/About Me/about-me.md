## Hey — I’m Nicholas Poon

I’m an Electrical Engineering student focused on building practical systems at the intersection of **RF, embedded, and hardware design**.  
I like projects where the requirements are real (range, power, noise, reliability) and the solution has to work outside the lab.

---

## What I’m into

- **RF / wireless systems** (links, antennas, front-ends, real-world constraints)
- **Embedded systems** (MCUs, sensors, protocols, debugging)
- **PCB design** (layout, power integrity, grounding, bring-up)
- **Systems thinking** (testing, iteration, documentation, making it robust)

---

## Highlights

- **Senior Design:** 10-series Li-ion Battery Management System (BMS) + supporting hardware  
  Focus: safety, monitoring, power delivery, validation strategy

- **Hands-on engineering:** I like owning the full loop: design → build → test → fix → ship

---

## Tools & skills

**Hardware**
- Schematic + PCB layout (power, mixed-signal basics)
- Lab bring-up, debugging, verification mindset

**Embedded**
- C/C++ on MCUs
- SPI / I2C / UART and common sensor integration

**Workflow**
- Version control (Git), structured documentation, repeatable testing

---

## What I’m looking for

Internships / projects in **defense, RF, embedded, PCB design**, or anything where I can build and validate real hardware.
